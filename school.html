					The AMW Summer School is a two day event preceding the Alberto Mendelzon Workshop on Foundations of Data Management 2018 to be held in Cali, Colombia. 
					The event consists of multiple tutorials aimed at a mixed audience of students and other interested attendees. </p>
					<h3>Our goals</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
						<li>Host tutorials targeted at students (advanced undergraduate or postgraduate level) or other early term researchers interested in the area of Data Management;
						</li>
						<li>Provide a venue where young Latin American students and researchers can meet, discuss, learn, and seek feedback on their research topics, thus reinforcing research networks (of the future) in the area.
						</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

									<h3>Miriam Fernandez, Knowledge Media Institute, Open University (UK)</h3>
									
									<h4>Introduction to Mining Social Media Data</h4>
									The Social Web has become one of the largest human information and communication systems in history, impacting the lives of billions of people around the world. This social phenomenon is transforming the world in ways that were never imagined, shaping how we communicate and share information, how we do business or how we elect governments. In this tutorial we will provide an introduction to different types of social media data (Twitter, Facebook, Wikis, Forums) and to some of the models, tools and methods to represent, enrich and analyse them. We will discuss how, by mining this unprecedented resource, we can help targeting societal challenges, such as policy making, climate change, or disaster management, among others. Note that presentations will be combined with hands-on sessions, so don't forget to bring your laptops with you!

									<h3>Fei Chiang, McMaster University (CA)</h3>
									 
									<h4>Introduction to Data Quality (co-presented with Mostafa Milani)</h4>
									Poor data quality is a challenging and costly problem leading to inaccurate and untrusted data analytics results.  Data cleaning involves enriching and structuring the raw data into a format that can be used in latter data management tasks.  In this tutorial, we discuss qualitative and quantitative approaches in data cleaning, and survey commonly used data quality rules for error detection, and their application in data repair techniques.  We also discuss contextual data quality, and present a multidimensional ontology that provides contextual data quality assessment by extending the multidimensional data model commonly found in OLAP and data warehousing applications.

									<h3>Denis Parra, PUC Chile (CL)</h3>
									
									<h4>A Tutorial on Information Visualization and Visual Analytics</h4>
									This tutorial introduces fundamental aspects in information visualization such as marks, channels, idioms, and principles from 
cognitive science which allow to design effective visualizations. In order to analyze existent visualizations and implement new ones
in a systematic way, we will introduce the framework by Munzner (2014) which addresses the problem with nested levels: Domain/situation (what), 
Data/task abstraction (why), visual encoding/interaction idiom (How), and algorithms. Several examples of existent visualizations are analyzed 
within this framework in order to understand its usage, and finally rules of thumb are synthesized for preventing common mistakes when
designing new visualizations. Finally, examples which combine data mining methods with visualizations are explained in detail in 
order to understand and eventually implement models for visual analytics.

									<h3>Martín Ugarte, Free University of Brussels (BE)</h3>
									
									<h4>Understanding the Bitcoin Protocol</h4>
									In the last five years, Bitcoin has gained a good deal of attention, reaching in December 2017 a market capitalization close to three hundred billion (US) dollars and a daily trading volume of hundreds of millions of dollars. Although Bitcoin is considered mostly as a financial asset, the protocol published in 2008 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto goes far beyond: it achieves consensus in a decentralized and trust-less network. In this tutorial we will discuss in detail how this consensus is achieved, from the underlying cryptography to the specifics of the protocol and the so-called Blockchain data structure. We will also discuss the incentives of the different actors in the Bitcoin network, and how these incentives complement the underlying cryptography to enforce the security of the digital currency.

					<h3>VLDB Student Travel Grants</h3>
					
					<p>
					Thanks to the generous support of the VLDB Endowment, we have travel grants available to offer students attending the AMW school and workshop. All students wanting to participate are encouraged to apply, however, preference will be given to students registered in a Latin American university. Grants will have a maximum value of US$1,500 to help cover flight, accommodation and registration in the main workshop. These grants will be awarded in cash at the event.
					</p>
					<p>
					If you are a student (undergrad or postgrad) attending the AMW school and workshop, and would like to receive travel support, please send an email to the AMW school chairs (Jarek Szlichta - jarek@szlichta.com and Domagoj Vrgoč - domagojvrgoc@gmail.com) stating why you would like to attend the school and how much support you would need.
					</p>
					<p>
					Please also CC your supervisor (or a professor in your department), and attach a short 1-page CV (including at least: name, address, universities attended, degrees achieved/in-progress, current position; and if applicable: theses and/or publications authored, supervisor, relevant professional experience, other important merits, etc.). In case you have a paper in the AMW workshop, please provide us with details of this in your email.
					</p>
					<p>
					We will then select those students who we feel stand to gain the most from the experience of attending the school.

					</p>
					<p>
					The students selected for the travel grants are expected to prepare a poster to be presented during the evening sessions of the school and the workshop.
					</p>
					<p>
					Deadline: April 11th </br>
					Notification: April 13th.
					</p>
